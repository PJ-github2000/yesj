      YOUTH EMPOWERING SERVICE - JESUITS

    <Text style={{ textAlign: 'justify', color: 'black' }} py={20}>
      In India, the Telugu speaking states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana consist of almost 85 million people of which a vast majority are young. Most of the youth living in rural, semi-urban and urban slum areas encounter the harsh realities of poverty, lack of education, unemployment, casteism, gender discrimination and social inequality. We exist to bring social, psychological, spiritual and practical help to young people in need, irrespective of their caste, religion and social background.

    <Text style={{ textAlign: 'justify', color: 'black' }} py={20}>
      Youth Empowering Service â€“ Jesuits (YES-J) is one of the ministries of the Andhra Jesuit Province of the Society of Jesuits that serves the needy, young people from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in India. Young people in our society can not only be the object of formation but could themselves become active agents of change if their energies, aptitudes, and talents are better channeled. We firmly believe that all young people, irrespective of their educational, social, religious, and economic backgrounds, are capable of fulfilling their potential for a better and meaningful life. Unfortunately, due to the unjust social structure in Indian society, lack of opportunities, resources, guidance, and support, many young people are pushed to margins and impoverished life situations.
